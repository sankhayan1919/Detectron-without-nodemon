**Social Media Analysis Platform**  

Our platform enforces strict access controls, encryption, and audit trails to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance.
Only authorized government personnel can use the tool, with mandatory multi-factor authentication and role-based permissions. 

1. Strict Access Controls
Only authorized government personnel with .gov or agency-verified emails can register. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all accounts.

Three-tier access: Analysts (submit cases), Supervisors (audit reports), Admins (manage users). Permissions align with operational hierarchy.

Analysis restricted to publicly available content; private data requires warrant documentation. Automated scraping avoids platform ToS violations.

All data encrypted with AES-256 (at rest) and TLS 1.3 (in transit). PDFs include SHA-256 hashes for tamper-proofing.

5. Immutable Audit Logs
All actions (logins, report generation) logged to write-only storage. Logs include timestamps, user IDs, and IP addresses.

6. Incident Response Protocol
Breaches reported to agency CISO within 1 hour. Automated account freeze for suspicious activity (e.g., failed logins).
